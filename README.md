# html_meme_generator
a simple meme generator built with html canvas

I built this during a week I decided that I needed some web-dev tools (like the web scraper). This is a simple meme-generator built with HTML canvas and a little Javascript.

It is by no means finished. I just wanted something to throw together some quick-and-dirty memes whenever I felt the need.

Next steps include a zoom function for both image and text.
